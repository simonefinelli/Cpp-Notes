# Cpp-Notes
Notes, suggestions and insights on one of the most difficult and complex 
programming languages: It's me C++!

## Repo Structure
The repository is structured in order to provide the reader a linear guide on 
the main topics of C ++, starting from the simplest to the most advanced.

In particular, the repository is divided into 3 main sections:
1. Beginner: contains the 'classic' programming topic;
2. Intermediate: discuss more complex topics, such as object-oriented programming;
3. Advanced: exposes advanced arguments that can help to understand better the 
   language and its facets.
